Breakout style game for the Oric computer

When I was young, I bougth a Oric Atmos computer (in 1984, I think). I wrote many small games ans also some utilites, in BASIC and in 6502 assembly code.

Some years later, il april 2003, I discover a C development kit for Oric, witch offers me the ability to write this game I dreamed to write some years ago. Just for fun.

You can find the source files, and the batch file to run the compiler. The binary is also present as a TAP file.

Enjoy !
