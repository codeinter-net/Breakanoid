Breakout style game for the Oric computer

When I was young, I bougth an Oric Atmos computer (in 1984, I think). I wrote many small games and also some utilites, in BASIC and in 6502 assembly code.

Some years later, in april 2003, I discover a C development kit for Oric, whitch offers me the ability to write this game I dreamed to create some years ago. Just for fun.

You can find the source files, and the batch file to run the compiler. The binary is also present as a TAP file.

Enjoy !
